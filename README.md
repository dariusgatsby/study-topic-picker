# The Merchant Chooses #
- When researching projects to do, or watching videos about how to prove you have tech skills often time the talking heads often suggest to "solve your own problems"
- So as I sat procastinating on what to study to enhance my DevOps skill, I realized that was my problem! Whenever there wasn't clear direction or motivation I would just... stop
- Even though I know what tools and tech would help it can all be a bit overwhelming at time to choose one and go in because you see a good job posting with a particular tech stack and think, well I gotta learn that too!
- Sometimes that can result in simple doing nothing because of overload. So as I sat watching spicee's AGDQ run of RE4 Remake, I thought you know who always shows and gives you what you need at the right time, the Merchant!
- So I embarked to create my own study picker GUI app that I plan to containerize because why not?
- in main.py is the code I wrote along with my good friend GPT (mainly for tkinter placements/measurements because I don't believe those are necesary skills for my desired role) to have a lightly featured study topic selector, with the ability to add, delete, and show topics, as well as pick at random.
- So when the merchant offers a good topic you have to take it!
